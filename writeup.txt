Requirements:
First requirement: In order to get the web service works, i just need to register a cloud service with
azure and create an azure cloud service project in my own local machine and publish it there as needed
The way the API works is that every time the user type in something the browser will make ajax call to 
the server requesting for a list of words that matches or starts with the input. In order to make each 
process fast, i stored all the word in a trie so fast retrieval.
Client-side AJAX and modify DOM: Like i mentioned above, everytime the user type in something, if the 
input is not empty, the browser will make call to the server to look for all the suggestions of that 
input. Once recieved, it will append each of the word into specified div in the html page 
The web service is a file called getQuerySuggestions.asmx and it followed the best practices by having 
comments on every function and type of the variable is used approriately. 
The whole cloud service is hosted on azure like i said above nad as shown in the screenshot.
